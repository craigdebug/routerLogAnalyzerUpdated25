# Router Log Analyzer

This is a simple log file analyzer for a common router log file output.

## Development Notes
- This project is intended as an upgrade of a older script that could benefit from some refactoring and cleanup.
- This project will currently have one developer, so pull requests may "look odd" when submitted and approved by the same developer.
- This project is not intended to be distributed for public use and the router this was created for will not be named.
- This project will keep a list of Issues here to track changes, fixes, and upgrades.
